This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell when using the `sort` function with lists containing elements of different, non-comparable types. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a solution to prevent the runtime error. The error arises because Haskell's `sort` function relies on the `Ord` type class, which defines the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.). If the list contains elements that cannot be compared using these operators, the `sort` function will fail with a runtime exception.
